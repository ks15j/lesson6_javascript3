### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Browser Object Model(BOM)
   The browser object model is a hierarchy of objects. Each object allows 
   programatic access to different aspects of the web browser or web page.
2. DHTL
   DHTL interactions can alter web page content without needing to reload. 
   It can also change the presentation of that content. 
   It can also be described as a combination of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 
3. Timeouts and Intervals
   Window objects time out and interval methods create code that executes
   automatically. Methods like the setTimeOut() method, the clearTimeout 
   method, and the set interval method can be used to work with window objects.
